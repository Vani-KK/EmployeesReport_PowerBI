The EmployeesReport was generated using PowerBI. This report shows the KPIs and the distributions of employees based on gender,center and also by department. The trends were analysed using line chart.I have used cards ,clustered bar charts and donut charts for visualization. Have even added the Slicer feature for dynamic filtering which makes visualization more effective.
